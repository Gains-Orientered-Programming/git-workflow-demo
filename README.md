# git-workflow-demo

Arguments for GitHub Flow:

Simplicity: GitHub Flow is easy to understand and implement, making it a good choice for smaller teams or projects.
Continuous Integration: It encourages continuous integration and testing since each feature or bug fix is developed in isolation in a branch.
Collaboration: Pull requests facilitate collaboration and code review.


Arguments against GitHub Flow:

Not Suitable for All Workflows: It may not be suitable for larger, more complex projects with long-lived feature branches.
Limited Versioning: The main branch always represents the latest production version, making it difficult to maintain multiple versions simultaneously.
